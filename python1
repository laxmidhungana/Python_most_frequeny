QUESTION:
Write a Python function that counts the frequency of each word in a given paragraph. 
The function should return the result as a dictionary. 
Additionally, provide a way to retrieve the most frequently occurring word(s) from this dictionary
input_paragraph = "Hello world Hello world This world is full of surprises Surprises are everywhere; surprises are fun"

SOLUTION:
def genatate_Dic(ll):
    dic = {}
    for y in ll:
        if y in dic:
            dic[y] = dic[y] + 1
        else:
            dic[y] = 1
    return dic

def frequent(dic):
    max_value = max(dic.values())
    ll=[]
    for x in dic.keys():
        if dic[x] == max_value:
            ll.append(x)
    return ll


if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_paragraph = "Hello world Hello world This world is full of surprises Surprises are everywhere surprises are fun"
    words2 = input_paragraph.lower().split(" ")
    d3 = genatate_Dic(words2)
    print(d3)
    list=frequent(d3)
    print("Most Frequent word(s) ", list)

OUTPUT:
{
    'hello': 2,
    'world': 3,
    'this': 1,
    'is': 1,
    'full': 1,
    'of': 1,
    'surprises': 3,
    'are': 3,
    'everywhere': 1,
    'fun': 1
}
Most frequent word(s): ['world', 'surprises']
